The typical Fizzbuzz code challenge use for developer screening. This is the cleanest and shortet I could think to implement the challenge... in python...

1. Print the numbers 1 to 100.
2. For every multiple divisible by 3, print fizz
3. For every multiple divisible by 5, print buzz
4. For multiples divisible by both, print fizzbuzz
